Installing the extension
------------------------

Install this extension as usual with Extension Manager. The whole configuration is made from the Admin Tools Backend module "Image Auto-Resize":

|backend_module|

.. note:
	Unlike many other extensions, it is based on a FlexForm to increase the user experience and allow creation of complex rule sets.
